# LinuxWebServer

## Description
This is a web server developed in Linux environment scripting in C++ to handle multiple http connections based on the implemented threadspool. 
The server implemented utilize the technique of epoll to listen to all sockets connecting to clients, and use finite-state-machine to handle and process different type of http requesting, responding to clients with different http response.
The server currently can only support limited http requesting, but will be further developed to support more functions in the future.
